A model which can recognize  the face with your name!
firstly, with the help of face generator file you will able to generate 100 images in Images folder.
create dataset folder in which you have to make another two folders named as train and test and stor your images in them by making another folder of images with there respective names.
Then, run the training phase for detection file in which I used vgg16,vgg19 and resnet for the training of the data.
After that use the best model out of it to test the image in real time(webcam).
